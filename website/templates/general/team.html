   <p>Youth Director</p> 
   <p>Travis has been married for 3 years to his beautiful wife Kelsey, and has lived in Northern Virginia his whole life. 
      He graduated Liberty University in 2011 with a degree in Youth Ministry with a specialization in Biblical Studies.
      His desire to lead youth with the truth of the gospel started when he was 18, and he stoped fighting the call God had on his life.
      Over the next 4 years he held different internships until he landed back here in his home town at Cedar Run. 
      In his free time you can find him either at the gym, hanging out with friends, or putting some time in on the Xbox. 
      When he does read he enjoys books from Francis Chan such as, "You and Me forever", and "Crazy Love". His life has been one huge 
      lesson from God, teaching, refining, and building what He wants for Travis, he is just along for the ride.</p>
